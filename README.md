# Final_Project
Machine Learning for Coronary Disease

Dataset used: 2patientsFinal.csv

The patient data found in the dataset was created using [Syntheaâ„¢](https://synthetichealth.github.io/synthea/) - an open-source, realistic patient generator that models the medical history of synthetic patients.

Specific demographic info, vital signs, and medical conditions were extracted from patients' health synthetic health records in order to create the following variables:
1. Age (in years)
2. Gender (male or female)
3. Race (asian, black, hispanic, native, other, white)
4. Zip code
5. BMI
6. Diastolic Blood Pressure
7. Systolic Blood Pressure
